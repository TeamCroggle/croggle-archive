# Croggle archive
In this repository you will find archived artifacts that were produced as by-products of Croggle.
They have been moved here because their development has stalled and a git repository became unnecessary, but also because they hadn't been hosted on the TeamCroggle Github organization before.

Most of the documents were written for the academic project from which Croggle evolved, called "PSE".
You will find them in the subdirectories prefixed wth "pse".
